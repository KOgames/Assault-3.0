ASSAULT 3.0 REDUX

This is the the Assault 3.0 as it was run by Demortes. 
This is open to the public, following the standard 
licenses of Ack and Assault as run by Amnon.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask 
me, although I, admittadly, will not always be the best resource.

These files were slightly modified by h3rb @ github.com to fix
compilation issues with modern GCC.  The splintered .h maze was
built back into ack.h and it now compiles on Ubuntu without many
errors.  Most of the warnings are about shadow declarations (a
benign issue), though some may indicate other issues which should
be addressed and quieted.

Make sure to modify the STAT_WEB_FILE and related settings in
web.h and ack.h related _FILE macros as they lead to crashes
during initial login.

This game now runs on orcs.biz port 4554 !  Enjoy.
